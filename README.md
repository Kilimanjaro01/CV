### Information Architecture

The website’s information is organized into four main sections to ensure clear and intuitive navigation. The **Home page** introduces the designer and the purpose of the site, creating a strong first impression. The **Portfolio section** showcases selected projects with images and short descriptions that help visitors quickly understand each project’s context. The **About page** provides background information about the designer’s education, skills, and approach to design. The **Contact page** includes a simple form and social media links, allowing potential employers or collaborators to get in touch easily.

This structure follows a linear and user-centered logic. Visitors can reach any part of the site in one or two clicks, promoting accessibility and engagement. The consistent navigation bar and footer help maintain orientation throughout the browsing experience.

### Visual Design

The visual design is based on minimalism and balance. The color palette uses neutral tones such as white, light gray, and black, combined with a single accent color (a soft blue) to highlight interactive elements like buttons and links. This ensures clarity and avoids visual overload. The typography combines a modern sans-serif font for headings and a clean serif font for body text, reinforcing readability and visual hierarchy.

Generous spacing and alignment were carefully applied to maintain a sense of order and sophistication. The layout adapts seamlessly to different screen sizes, ensuring the same quality experience on mobile and desktop devices. Visual consistency was prioritized through the use of recurring shapes, grid systems, and consistent margins. Overall, the design conveys professionalism, simplicity, and attention to detail—qualities that reflect the user’s identity as a creative professional.
